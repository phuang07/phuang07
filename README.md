### About me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on GenAI projects tailored for Higher Education Institutes, where technology meets academia to create a smarter future. 
- 🌱 I’m currently diving deeper into the realms of AI/ML, and Data Science, constantly seeking new knowledge and innovations in these fields.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that bridge the gap between technology and everyday life, especially in areas like personal fitness - running, and enhancing teaching & learning experiences in Higher Education.
- 🤔 I’m seeking insights and partnerships in the integration of AI/ML/DS in Bible Study & Research, exploring how these technologies can deepen our understanding of ancient texts.
- 💬 Ask me about how to use AI and ML to transform traditional sectors like education and personal wellness, or about the latest trends in Software Development.
